# LanguageExplore

Repository for the Language Explore Project I did Junior Year. We were supposed to implement a project on the level of an assignment from CSCI-262 at Mines in a language we didn't know. We chose Smalltalk, and implemented a program which allows the user to attempt to outthink a nearest neighbors algorithm on the Traveling Salesman Problem.
